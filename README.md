# Identifying sarcasm in Twitter

This is a curated bibliography on identifying sarcasm in tweets. I think it's quite comprehensive, at least with respect to formal conferences and journal publications. Important omissions include all the great work of the different challenge tasks (like [Evalita](http://www.evalita.it/2016)), for example. Please don't hesitate to send pull requests to this. I do believe in collaborative work.
