abstract = {Sarcasm is a peculiar form of sentiment expression, where the surface sentiment differs from the implied sentiment. The detection of sarcasm in social media platforms has been applied in the past mainly to textual utterances where lexical indicators (such as interjections and intensifiers), linguistic markers, and contextual information (such as user profiles, or past conversations) were used to detect the sarcastic tone. However, modern social media platforms allow to create multimodal messages where audiovisual content is integrated with the text, making the analysis of a mode in isolation partial. In our work, we first study the relationship between the textual and visual aspects in multimodal posts from three major social media platforms, i.e., Instagram, Tumblr and Twitter, and we run a crowdsourcing task to quantify the extent to which images are perceived as necessary by human annotators. Moreover, we propose two different computational frameworks to detect sarcasm that integrate the textual and visual modalities. The first approach exploits visual semantics trained on an external dataset, and concatenates the semantics features with state-of-the-art textual features. The second method adapts a visual neural network initialized with parameters trained on ImageNet to multimodal sarcastic posts. Results show the positive effect of combining modalities for the detection of sarcasm across platforms and methods.},

abstract = {Sarcasm annotation extends beyond linguistic expertise, and often involves cultural context. This paper presents our first-of-its-kind study that deals with impact of cultural differences on the quality of sarcasm annotation. For this study, we consider the case of American text and Indian annotators. For two sarcasm- labeled datasets of American tweets and dis- cussion forum posts that have been annotated by American annotators, we obtain annota- tions from Indian annotators. Our Indian an- notators agree with each other more than their American counterparts, and face difficulties in case of unfamiliar situations and named en- tities. However, these difficulties in sarcasm annotation result in statistically insignificant degradation in sarcasm classification. We also show that these disagreements between annotators can be predicted using textual prop- erties. Although the current study is limited to two annotators and one culture pair, our paper opens up a novel direction in evaluation of the quality of sarcasm annotation, and the impact of this quality on sarcasm classification. This study forms a stepping stone towards system- atic evaluation of quality of these datasets an- notated by non-native annotators, and can be extended to other culture combinations.},

abstract = {Sarcasm is a type of sentiment where people express their negative feelings using positive or intensified positive words in the text. While speaking, people often use heavy tonal stress and certain gestural clues like rolling of the eyes, hand movement, etc. to represent sarcastic. In the textual data, these tonal and gestural clues are missing, making sarcasm detection very difficult for an average human. Due to these challenges, researchers are showing interest in sarcasm detection of social media text, especially in tweets. Rapid growth of tweets in volume and its analysis pose major challenges. In this paper, we proposed a Hadoop based framework that captures real time tweets and process it with a set of algorithms which identifies sarcastic sentiment efficiently. We observe that the elapse time for analysing and processing under Hadoop based framework significantly outperforms the conventional methods and is more suited for real time streaming tweets.},

In the first, they clarified the meaning of existing sentences without altering the wording; in the second, they produced their own sentences. Results provided clear evidence that tongue and wink emoticons are the principal indicators of sarcastic intent, and that ellipsis is associated more with criticism, rather than with sarcasm. These findings highlight the significant role emoticons play in clarifying message intention, compensating for the absence of nonverbal cues in written communication.},

People often expressed it verbally through the use of heavy tonal stress and certain gestural clues like rolling of the eyes. These tonal and gestural clues are obviously not available for expressing sarcasm in text, making its detection reliant upon other factors. In this paper, two approaches to detect sarcasm in the text of Twitter data were proposed. The first is a parsing-based lexicon generation algorithm (PBLGA) and the second was to detect sarcasm based on the occurrence of the interjection word. The combination of two approaches is also shown and compared with the existing state-of-the-art approach to detect sarcasm. First approach attains a 0.89, 0.81 and 0.84 precision, recall and f − score respectively. Second approach attains 0.85, 0.96 and 0.90 precision, recall and f − score respectively in tweets with sarcastic hashtag.},

We re-frame the sarcasm detection task as a type of word sense disambiguation problem, where the sense of a word is either literal or sar- castic. We call this the Literal/Sarcastic Sense Disambiguation (LSSD) task. We address two issues: 1) how to collect a set of target words that can have either literal or sarcastic meanings depending on con- text; and 2) given an utterance and a target word, howto automatically detect whether the target word is used in the literal or the sarcastic sense. For the latter, we investi- gate several distributional semantics meth- ods and show that a Support Vector Ma- chines (SVM) classifier with a modified kernel using word embeddings achieves a 7-10{\%} F1 improvement over a strong lexical baseline.},

@article{Kunneman2015a,
abstract = {To avoid a sarcastic message being understood in its unintended literal meaning, in microtexts such as messages on Twitter.com sarcasm is often explicitly marked with a hashtag such as '{\#}sarcasm'. We collected a training corpus of about 406 thousand Dutch tweets with hashtag synonyms denoting sarcasm. Assuming that the human labeling is correct (annotation of a sample indicates that about 90{\%} of these tweets are indeed sarcastic), we train a machine learning classifier on the harvested examples, and apply it to a sample of a day's stream of 2.25 million Dutch tweets. Of the 353 explicitly marked tweets on this day, we detect 309 (87{\%}) with the hashtag removed. We annotate the top of the ranked list of tweets most likely to be sarcastic that do not have the explicit hashtag. 35{\%} of the top-250 ranked tweets are indeed sarcastic. Analysis indicates that the use of hashtags reduces the further use of linguistic markers for signaling sarcasm, such as exclamations and intensifiers. We hypothesize that explicit markers such as hashtags are the digital extralinguistic equivalent of non-verbal expressions that people employ in live interaction when conveying sarcasm. Checking the consistency of our finding in a language from another language family, we observe that in French the hashtag '{\#}sarcasme' has a similar polarity switching function, be it to a lesser extent.},

abstract = {Automatically detecting sarcasm in twitter is a challenging task because sarcasm transforms the polarity of an apparently positive or negative utterance into its opposite. Previous work focus on feature modeling of the single tweet, which limit the performance of the task. These methods did not leverage contextual information regarding the author or the tweet to improve the performance of sarcasm detection. However, tweets are filtered through streams of posts, so that a wider context, e.g. a conversation or topic, is always available. In this paper, we compared sarcastic utterances in twitter to utterances that express positive or negative attitudes without sarcasm. The sarcasm detection problem is modeled as a sequential classification task over a tweet and his contextual information. A Markovian formulation of the Support Vector Machine discriminative model as embodied by the SV M hmm algorithm has been employed to assign the category label to entire sequence. Exper- imental results show that sequential classification effectively embodied evidence about the context information and is able to reach a relative increment in detection performance},

The role of textual devices commonly used to accompany written sarcastic remarks is also unclear. The current research uses a rating task to investigate the influence of textual devices (emoticons and punctuation marks), on the comprehension of, and emotional responses to, sarcastic vs. literal criticism and praise, for both unambiguous (Experiment 1) and ambiguous (Experiment 2) materials. Results showed that sarcastic criticism was rated as less negative than literal criticism, and sarcastic praise was rated as less positive than literal praise, suggesting that sarcasm serves to mute the positive or negative nature of the message. In terms of textual devices, results showed that emoticons had a larger influence on both comprehension and emotional impact than punctuation marks.},

The hashtags that users employ to self-annotate their own micro-texts can often facilitate the targeted retrieval of texts with the desired characteristics. Though tweets tagged with {\#}sarcasm are highly likely to be sarcastic, the lack of a topic model for sarcastic tweets makes it difficult to detect when such tags are used in the expected way, or indeed, to retrieve tweets that are not explicitly tagged in this way. In this study, we explore how a tweet-retrieval and classification system can benefit from a topic model when constructing a task-specific Twitter corpus, such as for irony, sarcasm or metaphor detection.},

abstract = {Sarcasm is a special form of irony by which the person conveys implicit information, usually the opposite of what is said, within the message he transmits. Sarcasm is largely used in social networks and microblogging websites, where people mock or criticize in a way that makes it difficult even for humans to tell if what is said is what is meant. Recognizing sarcastic statements can be very useful when it comes to improving automatic sentiment analysis of data collected from social networks. It helps also enhance the efficiency of after-sales services or consumer assistance through understanding the intentions and real opinions of consumers when browsing their feedbacks or complaints. In this paper we propose a method to detect sarcasm in Twitter that makes use of the different components of the tweet. We propose four sets of features that cover different types of sarcasm we defined, and that will be used to classify tweets into sarcastic and non-sarcastic. We evaluate the performances of our approach. We study the importance of each of the proposed sets of features and evaluate its added value to the classification.},

However, identification of sarcasm is somewhat difficult due to the gap between its literal and intended meaning. Recognition of sarcasm is a task that can potentially pro- vide a lot of benefits to other areas of nat- ural language processing. In this research, we propose a new method to identify sarcasm in tweets that focuses on several approaches: 1) sentiment analysis, 2) concept level and common-sense knowledge 3) coherence and 4) machine learning classification. We will use support vector machine (SVM) to classify sarcastic tweet based on our proposed features as well as ordinary N-grams.

abstract = {Sarcasm is a common phenomenon in social media, and is inherently difficult to analyse, not just automatically but often for humans too. It has an important effect on sentiment, but is usually ignored in social media analysis, because it is considered too tricky to handle. While there exist a few systems which can detect sarcasm, almost no work has been carried out on studying the effect that sarcasm has on sentiment in tweets, and on incorporating this into automatic tools for sentiment analysis. We perform an analysis of the effect of sarcasm scope on the polarity of tweets, and have compiled a number of rules which enable us to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis when sarcasm is known to be present. We consider in particular the effect of sentiment and sarcasm contained in hashtags, and have developed a hashtag tokeniser for GATE, so that sentiment and sarcasm found within hashtags can be detected more easily. According to our experiments, the hashtag tokenisation achieves 98{\%} Precision, while the sarcasm detection achieved 91{\%} Precision and polarity detection 80{\%}.},

We created a large Czech Twitter corpus consisting of 7,000 manually-labeled tweets and provide it to the community.

Detection of sarcasm is of great importance and beneficial to many NLP applications, such as sentiment analysis, opinion mining and advertising. Current studies consider automatic sarcasm detection as a simple text classification problem. They do not use explicit features to detect sarcasm and ignore the imbalance between sarcastic and non-sarcastic samples in real applications. In this paper, we first explore the characteristics of both English and Chinese sarcastic sentences and introduce a set of features specifically for detecting sarcasm in social media. Then, we propose a novel multi-strategy ensemble learning approach(MSELA) to handle the imbalance problem. We evaluate our proposed model on English and Chinese data sets.

abstract = {To avoid a sarcastic message being understood in its unintended literal meaning, in microtexts such as messages on Twitter.com sarcasm is often explicitly marked with the hashtag ‘{\#}sar- casm'. We collected a training corpus of about 78 thousand Dutch tweets with this hashtag. Assuming that the human labeling is correct (annotation of a sample indicates that about 85{\%} of these tweets are indeed sarcastic), we train a machine learning classifier on the har- vested examples, and apply it to a test set of a day's stream of 3.3 million Dutch tweets. Of the 135 explicitly marked tweets on this day, we detect 101 (75{\%}) when we remove the hashtag. We annotate the top of the ranked list of tweets most likely to be sarcastic that do not have the explicit hashtag. 30{\%} of the top-250 ranked tweets are indeed sarcastic. Analysis shows that sarcasm is often signalled by hy- perbole, using intensifiers and exclamations; in contrast, non-hyperbolic sarcastic messages often receive an explicit marker. We hypothe- size that explicit markers such as hashtags are the digital extralinguistic equivalent of non- verbal expressions that people employ in live interaction when conveying sarcasm.},

This paper tests a bootstrap- ping method, originally proposed in a mono- logic domain, to train classifiers to identify two different types of subjective language in dialogue: sarcasm and nastiness. We explore two methods of developing linguistic indica- tors to be used in a first level classifier aimed at maximizing precision at the expense of re- call. The best performing classifier for the first phase achieves 54{\%} precision and 38{\%} recall for sarcastic utterances. We then use general syntactic patterns from previous work to cre- ate more general sarcasm indicators, improv- ing precision to 62{\%} and recall to 52{\%}. To further test the generality of the method, we then apply it to bootstrapping a classifier for nastiness dialogic acts. Our first phase, using crowdsourced nasty indicators, achieves 58{\%} precision and 49{\%} recall, which increases to 75{\%} precision and 62{\%} recall when we boot- strap over the first level with generalized syn- tactic patterns.},

For example, many sarcas- tic tweets include a positive sentiment, such as “love” or “enjoy”, followed by an expression that describes an undesirable activity or state (e.g., “taking exams” or “being ignored”).We have developed a sarcasm recognizer to iden- tify this type of sarcasm in tweets. We present a novel bootstrapping algorithmthat automati- cally learns lists of positive sentiment phrases and negative situation phrases from sarcastic tweets. We show that identifying contrast- ing contexts using the phrases learned through bootstrapping yields improved recall for sar- casm recognition. 1},

abstract = {While a fair amount of work has been done on automatically detecting emotion in human speech, there has been little research on sarcasm detection. Although sarcastic speech acts are inherently subjective, humans have relatively clear intuitions as to what constitutes sarcastic speech. In this paper, we present a system for automatic sarcasm detection. Using a new acted speech corpus that is annotated for sarcastic and sincere speech, we examine a number of features that are indicative of sarcasm. The first set of features looks at a baseline of basic acoustic features that have been found to be helpful in human sarcasm identification. We then present an effective way of modeling and applying prosodic contours to the task of automatic sarcasm detection. This approach applies sequential modeling to categorical representations of pitch and intensity contours obtained via k-means clustering. Using a SimpleLogistic (LogitBoost) classifier, we are able to predict sarcasm with 81.57{\%} accuracy. This result suggests that certain pitch and intensity contours are predictive of sarcastic speech.},

However, often it is impossible to identify a sentence containing sarcasm without knowing the context. In this paper we describe a corpus generation experiment where we collect regular and sarcastic Amazon product reviews. We perform qualitative and quantitative analysis of the corpus. The resulting corpus can be used for identifying sarcasm on two levels: a document and a text utterance (where a text utterance can be as short as a sentence and as long as a whole document).},

A novel task was employed: Given a set of statements that out of context were not rated as sarcastic, partic- ipants were instructed to either generate discourse context that would make the statements sarcastic or meaningful (without further specification). In a series of studies, these generated contexts were shown to differ from one another along the dimensions presumed as necessary (failed expectation, pragmatic insincerity, negative tension, and presence of a victim) and along stylistic components (as indexed by the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program). However, none of these componentswere found to be necessary. Indeed, in each case, the items rated as highest in sarcasm were often at the lowest levels on the putative “necessary” characteristic. These data are taken as consistentwith constraint satisfactionmodels of sarcasm processing in which various linguistic and extralinguistic informa- tion provide probabilistic (but not necessary) support for or against a sarcastic interpretation.

Recently, ‘expressivists' have argued that sarcasm is not a type of speaker meaning at all, but merely the expression of a dissociative attitude toward an evoked thought or perspective. I argue that we should analyze sarcasm in terms of meaning inversion, as the traditional theory does; but that we need to construe ‘meaning' more broadly, to include illocutionary force and evaluative attitudes as well as propositional content. I distinguish four subclasses of sarcasm, individuated in terms of the target of inversion. Three of these classes raise serious challenges for a standard implicature analysis.},

A factor analysis meaningfully grouped the dependent variables into separate factors, one of which indexed “victimization” and a second of which indexed “relational aggression.” The sarcastic version was perceived as more victimizing and more relationally aggressive, contrary to the muting hypothesis. Secondary analyses demonstrated that participants perceived the negative comment of the aggressor as more humorous and less aggressive when taking the perspective of the aggressor than when taking the perspective of the victim, and that male participants reported greater use of sarcasm in everyday life, but did not produce more when given the opportunity to do so.},

English and Cantonese utterances expressing sarcasm, sincerity, humorous irony, or neutrality through prosody were presented to English and Cantonese listeners unfamiliar with the other language. Listeners identified the communicative intent of utterances in both languages in a crossed design. Participants successfully identified sarcasm spoken in their native language but identified sarcasm at near-chance levels in the unfamiliar language. Both groups were relatively more successful at recognizing the other attitudes when listening to the unfamiliar language (in addition to the native language). Our data suggest that while sarcastic utterances in Cantonese and English share certain acoustic features, these cues are insufficient to recognize sarcasm between languages; rather, this ability depends on (native) language experience.},

Using a gold standard in which each sentence was tagged by 3 annotators, we obtained precision of 77{\%} and recall of 83.1{\%} for identifying sarcastic sentences.

In this paper we look at one commonly used framing device for linguistic irony-the simile-to show how even the most creative uses of irony are often marked in ways that make them computationally feasible to detect. We conduct a very large corpus analysis of web-harvested similes to identify the most interesting characteristics of ironic comparisons, and provide an empirical evaluation of a new algorithm for separating ironic from non-ironic similes.

We also demonstrate that clues based on deeper linguistic information are relatively inefficient in capturing irony in user-generated content, which points to the need for exploring additional types of oral clues.},

abstract = {Speakers and listeners make use of a variety of pragmatic factors to produce and identify sarcastic statements. It is also possible that lexical factors play a role, although this possibility has not been investigated previously. College students were asked to read excerpts from published works that originally contained the phrase said sarcastically, although the word sarcastically was deleted. The participants rated the characters' statements in these excerpts as more likely to be sarcastic than those from similar excerpts that did not originally contain the word sarcastically. The use of interjections, such as gee or gosh, predicted a significant amount of the variance in the participants' ratings of sarcastic intent. This outcome suggests that sarcastic statements may be more formulaic than previously realized. It also suggests that computer software could be written to recognize such lexical factors, greatly increasing the likelihood that non-literal intent could be correctly interpreted by such programs, even if they are unable to identify the pragmatic components of nonliteral language.},

abstract = {This paper considers two post-Gricean attempts to provide an explanatory account of verbal irony. The first treats irony as an echoic use of language in which the speaker tacitly dissociates herself from an attributed utterance or thought. The second treats irony as a type of pretence in which the speaker "makes as if" to perform a certain speech act, expecting her audience to see through the pretence and recognise the mocking or critical attitude behind it. The two approaches have sometimes been seen as empirically or theoretically indistinguishable, and several hybrid accounts incorporating elements of both have been proposed. I will argue that the echoic and pretence accounts are distinguishable on both theoretical and empirical grounds, and that while echoic use is essential to standard cases of verbal irony, pretence is not. However, the term irony has been applied to a very wide range of phenomena, not all of which can be explained in the same way, and I will end by briefly mentioning some less central cases where varieties of pretence or simulation do indeed achieve ironical effects. ?? 2006.},

People were presented with sponta- neously produced ironic and nonironic utterances from radio talk shows in written or auditory form, with or without written contextual information. When the utterances were read without written contextual information, all utterances were rated as equally ironic.

These effects were examined either when the focus was on the person who uttered the criticism (Study 1) or when the focus was on the person to whom the barb is directed (Study 2). Moreover, we studied the beliefs associated with sarcastic uses from four different points-of-view: from that of the speaker, from that of the target of the crit- icism, from that of an incidental overhearer and from a control no-perspective orientation. The main task involved reading a set of passages in which one of the characters criticized another either directly or via sarcasm. Participants completed a questionnaire for each passage about why the criticism was made. A set of reasons discriminated sarcastic from direct criti- cism, with twice as many discriminating reasons being observed when one considers what is in the mind of the person making the sarcastic comment (Study 1) relative to what is in the mind of the person who receives it (Study 2). Factor analyses indicated that many of the seemingly separate reasons reflect a common basis, primarily verbal aggression, though sep- arate factors indicated that verbal aggression made via sarcasm differs in some ways from that when made directly. Finally, there were some differences found in point-of-view, indicating that the effect the speaker believes his criticism has sometimes differs from the effect as seen by the victim.},

@article{Utsumi2000,
abstract = {This paper proposes an implicit display theory of verbal irony in order to provide a plausible explanation of how irony is distinguished from nonirony. The implicit display theory claims that verbal irony is an utterance or a statement that implicitly displays ironic environment, a proper situational setting in the discourse context, and that verbal irony is a prototype-based category. The notion of implicit display provides typicality conditions characterizing the prototype of verbal irony; the similarity between the prototype and an utterance is formulated as the degree of ironicalness. In order for an utterance to be interpreted ironically, the utterance must be recognized as achieving implicit display through the process of assessing the degree of ironicalness, and the discourse situation must be identified as ironic environment through the process of checking or inferring its constituent events/states. If these two criteria are satisfied, the utterance is judged to be ironic, otherwise it is judged to be non-ironic. This paper also argues that the implicit display theory overcomes several difficulties of the existing irony studies and that it is consistent with the empirical findings from psycholinguistics. These arguments indicate that the implicit display theory is a more adequate and comprehensive theory of verbal irony than the traditional pragmatic theory, the echoic interpretation theory, the pretense theory, and other theories.},

@article{Jorgensen1996,
abstract = {Brown and Levinson's (1987) theory of politeness, while partly supported by empirical studies, may not accommodate a number of relevant social and psychological variables. Accordingly, Kasper (1990) suggests investigating the 'forms and meanings of politeness' in a variety of discourse and social contexts. Since Brown and Levinson contend that irony may be used for face-saving, and Sperber and Wilson (1981) explain why irony is especially suitable for remarking on the failure of an expectation, the face-saving function of sarcastic irony in American discourse is the focus of this paper. The first study shows that sarcastic irony is typically used to complain to or criticize intimates, who are usually hearers of the remarks. Hearers' reactions to both sarcastic and directly stated remarks with comparable content were explored, and remarks expressing trivial and serious complaints, occurring in conversations between same-sex best friends, were compared. Overall, the results show that sarcasm can serve a face-saving function, making the speaker appear less rude and unfair, particularly when expressing a trivial criticism; humor contributes little to this face-saving. These results raise problems for Brown and Levinson's formula for degree of face-threat, which is discussed, along with explanations for sarcasm's face-saving properties.},

abstract = {This paper presents a unified theory of verbal irony tbr developing a computa- tional model of irony. The theory claims that an ironic utterance implicitly com- municates the fact that its utterance sit- uation is surrounded by ironic environ- ment which has three properties, but hearers can assume an utterance to be ironic even when they recognize that it implicitly communicates only two of the three properties. Implicit commu- nication of three properties is accom- plished in such a way that an utterance alludes to the speaker's expectation, vi- olates pragmatic principles, and implies the speaker's emotional attitude. This paper also describes a method for com- putationally formalizing ironic environ- ment and its implicit communication us- ing situation theory with action theory.},
